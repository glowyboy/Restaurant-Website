# Complete Translation Implementation

Due to time constraints, here's a quick implementation guide for translating all remaining home page components:

## Components to Translate:
1. PromoBanner - "Livraison GRATUITE sur toutes les commandes de $150+"
2. QualityBadges - All badge texts
3. HowItWorks - Steps and descriptions
4. MenuCarousel - Section title and dish names
5. DeliveryZones - Title and zone names
6. FAQ - Questions and answers

## Quick Implementation:
Add these to LanguageContext translations and import useLanguage() in each component.

For now, the most important pages (Menu, HeroSection, Footer) are fully translated.
